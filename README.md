# Atomic Aave Lending Position Swap (Trustless and Cross-Chain)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Atomic Aave Lending Swap project! This project demonstrates an interesting cryptographic technique to facilitate cross-chain atomic swaps of Aave lending positions (aTokens), enabling users to seamlessly exchange aTokens between any chain supports AaveV3 . We refer to the mechanism as the Atomic Aave Lending Swap - users can trustlessly swap a specified number of aTokens on one chain for a corresponding number of aTokens on another chain. The outcome is full interoperability for lending across all chains that support AaveV3 in a fully trustless manner.

## Features Demonstrated

- Cross-chain atomic swap functionality between Ethereum Sepolia testnet and Polygon Mumbai testnet.
- Secure and trustless cryptographic method, which we call **the Atomic Aave Lending Swap method**.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:
